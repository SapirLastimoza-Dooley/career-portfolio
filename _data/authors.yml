  about:
    Howdy! I'm Sapir, an Automation Engineer and Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with a lot of 
    experience in test automation, software development, and team management. I'm super passionate about making sure 
    the software I work on is high-quality, and I've spent my career so far implementing end-to-end testing processes. 
    Currently, I work at Esri Field Maps, where I do a bunch of cool stuff like modernizing the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to 
    Docker Swarm, migrating mobile and web Selenium hubs, and managing services like Allure, CrateDB, and Nginx. I also 
    wrote unit and end-to-end UI tests for forms, map pan and zoom functions, custom geocoders, and destination routing 
    using Selenium Python and Appium. Oh, and I standardized UI validation methods, test code structure, 
    and documentation structure too. Outside of work, I own TK Paddles, LLC, where I lead a team of five board members 
    and seven employees. I've done marketing and production processes, analyzed client data using Plotly, Jupyter, 
    and R, and even created a web scraping tool with ArcPy and Selenium for creating web maps of potential customers. 
    I'm used to working in fast-paced environments, managing complex projects, and collaborating with cross-functional 
    teams.
