description: >
  In this project, we are interested in analyzing these datasets for elevation inconsistencies, correcting those errors and producing 3D Perspective View Models to depict elevation distribution in an easy-to-understand manner. We will be performing all analysis in ENVI and creating models using the 3D Surface View function.
