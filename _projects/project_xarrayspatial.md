description: >
  The purpose of this project is to provide an open-source tool for performing raster analysis on large datasets without the use of GDAL / GEOS. With tools ranging from classification, to multispectral analysis, to pathfinding. Xarray-Spatial gives the open-source community the ability to perform raster analysis quickly and easily through DASK and Numba integration.
