description: >
  The purpose of this project is to analyze CORS base station velocity from the NOAA database to determine projected shifts in spatial data with the implementation of TRF 2022, then compare that data to on-site data collected using a Leica GNSS RTK Rover. With this data we determine the affect the changes will have on spatial-related policy in the environmental, energy, and infrastructure sectors.
